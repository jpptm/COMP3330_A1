# COMP3330_A1
Repository for COMP3330 assignment 1 - SVM's and ANN's

There are two scripts for ANNs - ann_main.py and ann_no_batch.py
ann_no_batch was mainly for debugging to see how everything works when training ANNs using torch
ann_main is the script that is equipped with the batch feature
The class that instantiates the network is found in ~/networks/ann.py

svm.py contains everything for training and testing SVM models.

lc.py is a debugging script for learning curves.

All dataset parsers can be found in dataset
