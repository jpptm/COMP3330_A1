# COMP3330_A1
Repository for COMP3330 assignment 1 - SVM's and ANN's

There are two scripts for ANNs - ann_main.py and ann_no_batch.py.
The script ann_no_batch was mainly for debugging to see how everything works when training ANNs using torch.
The script ann_main is the script that is equipped with the batch feature.
The class that instantiates the network is found in ~/networks/ann.py.

The script svm.py contains everything for training and testing SVM models.

The script lc.py is a debugging script for learning curves.

All dataset parsers can be found in the directory dataset.

bupa.py contains all the code for the second question.

When running the scripts, please make sure to be in the same working directory as the repository.
It is recommended to open the repository using VS code to do this automatically. Thank you very much!
